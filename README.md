Notes App Front end part.

A fullstack training project app designed for saving notes.

Frontend part of the project is based on React. State mangement is based on Redux. E2E tests are written on Cypress. Axios is used for communication with backend part. Next thing to work on here is styling which is going to be made with StyledComponents. I am also planning to host app on Heroku.

It is a training project App that still has many issues which I'working on. Backend part is in notes-app repo.
